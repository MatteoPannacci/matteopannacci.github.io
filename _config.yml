          Throughout high school, I participated in various student competitions in Math, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Computer Science at the school, regional, and national levels, both individually and as a team leader.

          During my fourth year of high school, I was selected for and attended the "Scuola Estiva Nazionale per Studenti sulla Fisica Moderna 2019" (SENS-FM2019), which took place at the University of Udine.

        title: Machiavelli Planning
        caption: January 2025
        link: https://github.com/MatteoPannacci/machiavelli-planning
        link_text: Github repository
        description: |
          Implementation in PDDL and IndiGolog of a planning task from the italian card game Machiavelli. 
          We take into consideration a single turn of a player during the course of the game. The goal is to check whether it's possible for the player to win from the current configuration (board state and player's hand) and, in the positive case, to find a sequence of legal actions that do so.

        caption: May 2024

        link_text: Github repository
        description: |
          Implementation in Python of 2 class structures representing RDFS-based Knowledge Graphs. The first version uses a Neo4J Session to perform updates, syntax check and deduction directly on the graph through queries in Cypher. The second version performs these operations in Python and is able to interact with a Neo4J Session for importing/exporting Knowledge Graphs.

        caption: September 2024

        link_text: Github repository
        description: |
          Implementation of a simple 2D trajectory planner for ROS in C++. The code provides a node that listens to the required informations (current position, map structure and goal position), then it uses these informations to build the trajectory planning problem and solves it applying the A* algorithm. The resulting path is then visualized using OpenCV.

        link_text: Github repository
        description: |
          Implementation of ES (Evolutive Strategy) and GA (Genetic Algorithm) using multiple independent populations in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to train neural networks (Neuro-Evolution). The agents learn to play classic games from the PettingZoo library including Connect Four and TicTacToe by having the populations compete against each other.

        description: |
          Implementation of augmentation strategies and trasformer-based models for NLI (Natural Language Inference) on the FEVER dataset. The augmentation strategies are based on WSD (Word Sense Disambiguation) and SRL (Semantic Role Labeling) informations provided with the dataset.

        description: |
          Research collaboration with the ALCOR Lab at the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering (DIAG) of Sapienza University of Rome, conducted during my master's degree. The work focused on improving ground-to-aerial image matching techniques using semantic segmentation to enhance alignment and comparison of images from different viewpoints.

          This collaboration led to the publication of the paper "Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation" of which I'm a co-first author.
